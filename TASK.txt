Fullstack:
      => Full stack technology refers to the entire depth of computer application, about both the front end and the back end.
      => full stack development deals with both frontend and backend web development.
      => front end development deals with visible parts  application for web browser, mainly focus about client or site viewer , we see and interact
      => backend development deals with code communicate with servers, database.
      =>knowledge about both frontend and backend is called fullstack development.

Technologies involved in fullstack development:
     (i) frontend technologies:
               HTML, CSS, Javascript, React are the basic technology for learning frontend technologies.
     (ii) backend technologies:
               PHP ,Python, JavaScript,Laravel, Django, MongoDB, MySQL are used for backend technologies.

Roles and responsibilities of full stack development:
      Role of fullstack developer is to be fluent in creating websites with internal architecture and delivering interactive and userfriendly interface to clients.
      Responsiblities of fullstack developer helping with design and development of software
      creating servers and database for the backend of the software.

Network:
      Network is formed when two or more computers linked together and share any of their data to any of their computer.
      There are 5 types of Network, they are 
             1.Local area network: Two computers linked together and share their data.
             2.Metropolitical area network: All computers on a particular city or large campus linked together and share their data.
             3.Wide Area Network: It covers long distance and link all the computer.
             4.wireless network.It is a computer network that uses wireless data connections between network nodes.
             5.Internetwork:Connect different networks by intermediate devices.

Network topology:
       It connects different computer in particular network.
       Types of Network topology:
             1.Bus Network:All devices are connected to a common cable.
             2.Ring Network:All devices are connected to one another in the shape of closed loop.
             3.Star Network:All hosts are connected to a central device known as hub device, using point to point connection.
      these are the basic network topologies.
